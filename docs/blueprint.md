## Core Features:

- Game Board UI: Display the game board with the character, enemies, and interactive elements.
- Scripting Interface: Provide a drag-and-drop interface for building movement scripts using commands like 'Move Forward,' 'Turn Left,' 'Turn Right,' and 'Pause.'
- Script Display: Display the current movement script sequence.
- Script Execution: Execute the created movement script to control the character's actions.
- Enemy AI: Define and implement enemy movement patterns with increasing complexity.
- Reset Functionality: Reset the game board and script to the initial state.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3498DB) to represent the virtual space and order.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECF0F1) to keep the focus on the game elements.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#E67E22) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy feel, suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use minimalist icons to represent movement commands (forward, left, right, pause).
- Divide the screen into three sections: the game board, the scripting area, and the control buttons (Run, Reset).
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations to provide feedback when executing scripts or when enemies move.
